## Build instructions

    npm install

(starts watching for changes..)

## Note to self: todo

- Make z-index temporary by reordering DOM elements between actions
- Fix moving
- Enhance API, make more generic
- Make cards flippable
- Maybe use translate3d for even better performance, but make that temporary because of the smoothing issue
