## build instructions

    npm install
    npm start

(starts watching for changes..)

## Note to self: todo

- Make z-index temporary by reordering DOM elements between actions
- Fix moving
- Make API more open
- Make cards flippable
- Maybe use translate3d for even better performance, but make that temporary because of the smoothing issue
